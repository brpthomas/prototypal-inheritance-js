GA Sample Teach - JS Prototypal Inheritance 

# Sample Teach - Prototyopal Inheritance 

## Recap 
What have we covered so far? 
* We have covered variables, functions, objects, and callbacks in JavaScript. 

## Learning Objectives 
By the end of the lesson, you will be able to do the following: 
* Be able to use the constructor function to create objects
* Understand why prototypes are useful
* Understand the example that implement a prototype chain
* Be able to use the understanding of prototypes to walkthrough and create an prototype example 
* Be able to understand OLOO vs Class 


## Opening
What is about to happen? How and why? 
* Today we will be covering prototypal inheritance in Javascript! We have already covered variables, functions, objects, and callbacks in JavaScript which on the surface is super powerful, because it allows us to create complicated programs to develop web apps like most websites we visit everyday! So let's take a look under the hood. 


## Introduction/Background
### Let's frame this so that we're all on the same page! 
* In JavaScript, what are functions? Functions are actually objects! As such, they have properties and methods!
*

## Constructor 
By now, you have created an object already, but how did you create it? 
More than likely, it was like this below: 
```javascript
let myObject = {
	name: 'Thing 1',
	color: 'orange'
}

```

## Prototypes
### What is a prototype? 
Prototypes are how objects in JS inherits its methods and properties. 

### Why are prototypes useful? 

### Prototypes in ACTION!
